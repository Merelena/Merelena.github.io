# About me 
I'm a stugent of Minsk Radioengineering College and my specialty is "Information Technology Softiware".

I never miss an oppotunity to learn something new, to get experience and to improve my skills. Now I'm learning Delphi (according to the curriculum) and C# languages. My creativity helps me to do my life brighter and more interesting.
